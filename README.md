# TicTacToe with minimax
## Code with Python and Javascript, user interface in Html+css+Js
Create a program in python and Javascript that uses the minimax algorithm to play the game Tic Tac Toe that never lose

The program is separated in three parts:
#### 1) Create the user interface in HTML, CSS and Javascript

In the interface, the user is allowed to select his move, and the program verifies if it's a win, a lose or a tie, theoretically the user will never win the game, so it will only shows "Tie game" or "you lose". it will show the whole table in blue if it's a tie and the table in red if the user loses.

#### 2) Implement the minimax algorithm in Javascript or Python


The minimax algorithm is used to loop through all the possible moves and select the best. 


#### 3) Create an app that tells the python program what is the table status
